INTRODUCTION                                    *vim-bufdir*

Vim-bufdir provides a handful of convenience functions for changing Vim's
working directory.


COMMANDS                                        *vim-bufdir-commands*

                                                *:Bufdir*
:Bufdir                      Echoes the directory that the current buffer
                             resides in.

:Bufdir {args}               Changes the working directory to the directory
                             that the current buffer resides in, executes
                             {args} as commands, and then returns to the
                             original directory.

                             Examples: >
                                 :Bufdir :e ..
                                 :Bufdir :ter ++shell echo "I am in" && pwd
<
                             NOTE: If the argument commands act
                             asynchronously, and manipulate the working
                             directory while doing so, this may not behave as
                             expected. In such a case, |:Chbufdir| then
                             |:Chlaunchdir| should be used instead.

                                                *:Chbufdir*
:Chbufdir                    Changes the working directory to the directory
                             that the current buffer resides in.

                                                *:Chlaunchdir*
:Chlaunchdir                 Changes the working directory to the working
                             directory when Vim was initially launched (or,
                             more technically, when this plugin was loaded).

                                                *:Launchdir*
:Launchdir                   Functions like |:Bufdir|, but instead of acting
:Launchdir {args}            on the directory of the current buffer, uses the
                             working directory when Vim was initially launched
                             (or, more technically, when this plugin was
                             loaded).

                                                *:Resetlaunchdir*
:Resetlaunchdir              Resets the launch directory stored by this plugin
                             to the current working directory.
